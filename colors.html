    <strong>#Approximate Analogy</strong>
    <p>
      The way color is described in <i>The Complete Color Harmony</i> is very similar to how sound operates. 
      In high school, my choir director always compared sound to color; which isn't a far comparison. 
      The notes are hues (red or yellow to A or C), octaves are value (light and dark vs high and low), intensity/saturation is the volume (dynamics). 
      But my choir director is not the first one to note this comparison, in fact, 
      Radio Lab did a story on colors told through music a few years ago when describing how mantis shrimp experience color. Truly one of my favorite podcasts I've heard before, definitely worth a listen.
      Colors convey emotion similarly to how music can, though both are up to the audience's interpretation. Colors can allude to emotions of calmness, excitement, or anger, through greens, yellows, and reds (respectively); but music can allude to anticipation, sadness, and joy based on the key and tempo of a song.

    #Freeform
  </strong>
  <p> My favorite color has always been red, thanks to Ariel in <i>The Little Mermaid</i>. I grew up wanting to be like Ariel in every way, I became a swimmer and I sang in the choir. I am not a fan of change, so my favorite color is still red. In high school I joked I just wanted to go to Nebraska or Wisconsin for the school colors rather than for the academic programs. 
    Red is "compelling", "courageous", " "
