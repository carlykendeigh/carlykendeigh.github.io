    <p style="text-align: left";>In this exercise, our design class was asked to visit an art museum and analyze a piece based on the principles we have discussed in class. In visiting the Sheldon Art Museum in Lincoln, NE, I noticed the colorful, vibrant work of Peter Saul’s Abstract Expressionist Still Life. Peter Saul was born in San Fransisco, CA, where he started his career working on pop culture cartoon references. He is considered to be one of the fathers of the Pop Art movement (Tauer). His work is typically pop art, surrealism, or expressionism, with varying categories on occasion. His work has historically reflected current events, though he claims that more recently he has focused his work to turn away from his political past. The work I found in the Sheldon was done as an acrylic on canvas in 2016. This piece follows his tradition of relating pop art to political events, having quoted, “I have a feeling that abstract expressionism was caused by a certain nervousness that came about because of World War II. I think everybody was drinking coffee and smoking, and it made everyone so jittery they couldn't paint buttons and noses and things, you know; they just couldn't do it. Their patience was shot by the war.”

    Color Balance:
    The piece encompasses a wide range of colors, but the most notable throughout is the use of the red and pink tones that take up the top half of the work. The piece is overall very warm, with yellow undertones throughout the use of greens and blues. The artwork correlates almost directly with the “6, 3, 1” rule of UI (Jeph). 60% of the piece is red (or pink), taking up the primary background color, the two cars, and a majority of the liquid splashing. 30% of the piece is the secondary color (yellow) – taking up a third of the background as well as a few placements through cheese slices or hands holding wine glasses and coffee cups. The final 10% of the piece takes on a variety of accent colors: blue, orange, green, and brown. These colors draw more attention from the viewer since they “stick out”, but because the use of these accents is drawn across the entirety of the work, the viewer has to keep looking around the piece with no direct spot to land (see Direction of the Eye for details).
    
    Emotive Colors:
    As described above with the 6, 3, 1 rule, the piece is dominated by red and pink shades – which embody the hopeful, immature, energized, nature the piece embodies. The war was distracting and overwhelming – so were the colors and movements of this piece. In the reading by Arnheim, the author describes, “More generally, it is probably the expressive qualities … that spontaneously affect the passively receiving mind, whereas the tectonic structure of [a] pattern
    …engages the actively organizing mind.”. This reading has some outdated language, but the main idea is that the use of colors to express emotion – specifically in pattern forms – engages more emotional centers of the brain rather than exclusively visual processors. (Arnheim 336) The reading goes on to suggest that the use of colors evokes an emotional response based on the color’s emotive history (red = passion, blue = serenity, etc). The muted colors of green and yellow bring the element of balance and youthfulness to the piece without distracting too much from the red hues. Also worth noting is the blue is the least present color in the peace, which emphasizes how this was a time without much stability or peacefulness for the viewers (relating to WWII).
