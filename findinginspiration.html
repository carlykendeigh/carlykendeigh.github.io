            <p class="blogtext">
                In this exercise, our design class was asked to visit an art museum
                and analyze a piece based on the principles we have discussed in
                class. In visiting the Sheldon Art Museum in Lincoln, NE, I noticed
                the colorful, vibrant work of Peter Saul’s Abstract Expressionist
                Still Life. Peter Saul was born in San Fransisco, CA, where he
                started his career working on pop culture cartoon references. He is
                considered to be one of the fathers of the Pop Art movement (Tauer).
                His work is typically pop art, surrealism, or expressionism, with
                varying categories on occasion. His work has historically reflected
                current events, though he claims that more recently he has focused
                his work to turn away from his political past. The work I found in
                the Sheldon was done as an acrylic on canvas in 2016. This piece
                follows his tradition of relating pop art to political events,
                having quoted, “I have a feeling that abstract expressionism was
                caused by a certain nervousness that came about because of World War
                II. I think everybody was drinking coffee and smoking, and it made
                everyone so jittery they couldn't paint buttons and noses and
                things, you know; they just couldn't do it. Their patience was shot
                by the war.”

                <br />
                <br />
                <strong>Color Balance:</strong>
                The piece encompasses a wide range of colors, but the most notable
                throughout is the use of the red and pink tones that take up the top
                half of the work. The piece is overall very warm, with yellow
                undertones throughout the use of greens and blues. The artwork
                correlates almost directly with the “6, 3, 1” rule of UI (Jeph). 60%
                of the piece is red (or pink), taking up the primary background
                color, the two cars, and a majority of the liquid splashing. 30% of
                the piece is the secondary color (yellow) – taking up a third of the
                background as well as a few placements through cheese slices or
                hands holding wine glasses and coffee cups. The final 10% of the
                piece takes on a variety of accent colors: blue, orange, green, and
                brown. These colors draw more attention from the viewer since they
                “stick out”, but because the use of these accents is drawn across
                the entirety of the work, the viewer has to keep looking around the
                piece with no direct spot to land (see Direction of the Eye for
                details).
                <br />
                <br />
                <strong>Emotive Colors:</strong>
                As described above with the 6, 3, 1 rule, the piece is dominated by
                red and pink shades – which embody the hopeful, immature, energized,
                nature the piece embodies. The war was distracting and overwhelming
                – so were the colors and movements of this piece. In the reading by
                Arnheim, the author describes, “More generally, it is probably the
                expressive qualities … that spontaneously affect the passively
                receiving mind, whereas the tectonic structure of [a] pattern
                …engages the actively organizing mind.”. This reading has some
                outdated language, but the main idea is that the use of colors to
                express emotion – specifically in pattern forms – engages more
                emotional centers of the brain rather than exclusively visual
                processors. (Arnheim 336) The reading goes on to suggest that the
                use of colors evokes an emotional response based on the color’s
                emotive history (red = passion, blue = serenity, etc). The muted
                colors of green and yellow bring the element of balance and
                youthfulness to the piece without distracting too much from the red
                hues. Also worth noting is the blue is the least present color in
                the peace, which emphasizes how this was a time without much
                stability or peacefulness for the viewers (relating to WWII).
                <br />
                <br />
                <strong>Direction of the Eye (Motion in the Piece):</strong>
                Movement is arguably the most influential component of this piece.
                “The focus is “guided” in a composition… the visual representation
                of movement, for example, a speeding car or someone running, or the
                illusion or implication of it” (Meyer) The reading describes how art
                can easily guide a viewer’s eyes to the intended motion of a piece,
                but in Saul’s work noted above there is intentionally no direction
                for the eyes to land on. There is clear movement in the liquids from
                the cup and the shrinking and expansion of legs and cars to keep the
                eye moving towards one end, but the images mash into each other to
                keep the eye circling throughout the piece. This is what Meyer
                describes as “implied movement”: “We can look at implied movement as
                an action that is about to occur or the suggestion of a movement.
                This can also involve the transition between two movements. An
                example often used is the transition between someone walking and
                running, or dancing, or someone throwing a ball. This can be
                depicted by placing the focus on the figure’s posture, which can be
                “off-center” or “off-balance” to convey a sense of transition in
                motion” (Meyer). When analyzing this piece with the rule of thirds,
                the grid doesn’t line up with any particular subjects in a clear
                frame or aligned on a powerpoint, this also enhances the motion
                since there is no comfortable place for the viewer to find an object
                – they have to continue scanning through the scene which adds to
                Saul’s description of unrest the piece embodies. Even the background
                of the piece is morphed into itself, giving everything this
                destructive, melted feeling.

            <p class="blogtext"><strong>UI Sketch</strong>
                This UI is for a casino/hotel service that lets your experience be as
                authentic as possible to the casino lifestyle before stepping through
                the doors. You can makr favorites, see pricing, compare club levels,
                and get notified of changes. There is the use of the complementary
                green and red as pictured in Saul's work to keep the eye moving around
                the page but also physical movement with the carousel of casino
                options constantly and freely moving to never let a user get too
                comfortable in one spot on the page. The use of green and red play
                into the viewers emotions to correlate with money, excitement, and
                passion.
