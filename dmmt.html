        <h3>Chapters 1-5</a></h3>
        <p>This was the first time I had ever been so painfully aware of how much happy talk is on a website. I made a
          map of a site I use every single day (Canvas), and the path that I follow to get to my desired task. Since the
          most frequent task I do on Canvas is downloading PDFs, I blurred out all of the irrelevant information in
          relation to my task.
          It highlights the importance of conciseness and simplicity in a design, trying to eliminate as much
          unnecessary content as possible.

        <h3>Chapters 6 and Colin Breck: Understanding Our Core Values: An Exercise for Individuals and Teams</a></h3>
        <strong> Word Journal</strong>
        <p> <s>Authenticity</s> Transparency
          Colin Breck writes to center a successful company around values, which brings colleagues together to focus on
          one, authentic, focus.
          He questioned the stereotypical portrayal of a leader, often involving confidence and boldness. Instead, he
          embraced a broader definition, one that connects with personal values and accepts vulnerability.
          He states that embodying values, not just talking about them, is what defines a true leader. After taking the
          time to identify his own values, Breck could be a more authentic leader and motivate others to do the same.
          Sharing his values with his team brought them closer and made a more cohesive work environment. Maybe the
          focus of values is less on authenticity, while it is still very important, but more on transparency — and
          sharing your needs and strengths with the people you surround yourself with.
          I took the time after reading to identify some of my key values and what aligns closest to my needs and work
          ethic: Empathy, Communication, and Creativity. I always look at situations from multiple perspectives, and
          feel the most successful when I am constantly sharing motivation and communication with my teammates.
          Creativity is an essential part of my values, without it I get burnt out easily and struggle to find a good
          reason to keep working, so I adjust to give myself a creative outlet when necessary to stay my most productive
          self.</p>

        <h3>Chapters 7</a></h3>
        <strong> Approximate Analogy</strong>
        <p>The hierarchy of a webpage is very similar to labels of shelves and areas in a library.
          Imagine stepping into a library, greeted by shelves neatly stacked with books. Now, envision these shelves as
          the visual hierarchy of a website's homepage.
          The books placed at eye level in the library are akin to the primary content and key actions presented
          prominently on the website's landing page.
          Just as these eye-level books are the most accessible and frequently sought, the critical content and primary
          user actions should be noticeable and easily accessible on the webpage.
          On the other hand, books on higher or lower shelves in the library represent content of secondary importance,
          mirroring the placing of less crucial information in a well-structured hierarchy on the website.
          Much like a library's organized layout aids readers, a website's well-designed homepage helps users find what
          they need, providing a seamless experience without overwhelming users.</p>

    <h3>Chapters 8,9 | DOET Ch 5</a></h3>
    <strong> Concept Map / Freeform </strong>
    <p> The DMMT chapters focused on a Trunk-Test Style user experience to find the misuses and misconceptions on a
      website from testing. DOET covered <i>why</i> humans make mistakes or slips -- and the psychology behind user
      error as opposed to design error.</p>

    <h3> Pages 137-141 </a></h3>
    <p><strong>Efficiency</strong>
      Efficiency is relevant to usability tests, focus groups, and do-it-yourself testing. In a focus group, you can
      gain
      insight to people’s reactions to new concepts and gauge their opinions on topics pertaining to your product or
      site.
      However, drawing out the process of discussion in focus groups is time consuming — so balancing the use of
      specific
      questions and follow up questions allow the participants to get straight to the point while still feeling like
      their
      voice is heard. In a usability test, Krug argues the most efficient manner of usability test is do-it-yourself
      testing. In this method, the expensive and complicated form of user testing is quickened for maximum feedback and
      repetition opportunities. Using smaller groups to test with and giving less tasks to the groups can shorten the
      time
      span. This method is used more frequently in the app development process than the traditional style of user
      testing,
      which allows for more modifications to the site based on user feedback before it is pushed out as a final product.
