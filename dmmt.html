    <strong>#Concept Map</strong>
    <h3>Chapters 1-5</a></h3>
    <p>This was the first time I had ever been so painfully aware of how much happy talk is on a website. I made a map of a site I use every single day (Canvas), and the path that I follow to get to my desired task. Since the most frequent task I do on Canvas is downloading PDFs, I blurred out all of the irrelevant information in relation to my task. 
        It highlights the importance of conciseness and simplicity in a design, trying to eliminate as much unnecessary content as possible.

  <h3>Chapters 6 and Colin Breck: Understanding Our Core Values: An Exercise for Individuals and Teams</a></h3>
  <strong> Word Journal</strong>
  <p> <s>Authenticity</s> Transparency
    Colin Breck writes to center a successful company around values, which brings colleagues together to focus on one, authentic, focus. 
    He questioned the stereotypical portrayal of a leader, often involving confidence and boldness. Instead, he embraced a broader definition, one that connects with personal values and accepts vulnerability. 
    He states that embodying values, not just talking about them, is what defines a true leader. After taking the time to identify his own values, Breck could be a more authentic leader and motivate others to do the same. 
    Sharing his values with his team brought them closer and made a more cohesive work environment. Maybe the focus of values is less on authenticity, while it is still very important, but more on transparency â€” and sharing your needs and strengths with the people you surround yourself with.
     I took the time after reading to identify some of my key values and what aligns closest to my needs and work ethic: Empathy, Communication, and Creativity. I always look at situations from multiple perspectives, and feel the most successful when I am constantly sharing motivation and communication with my teammates.
      Creativity is an essential part of my values, without it I get burnt out easily and struggle to find a good reason to keep working, so I adjust to give myself a creative outlet when necessary to stay my most productive self.</p>

  <h3>Chapters 7</a></h3>
  <strong> Approximate Analogy</strong>
<p>The hierarchy of a webpage is very similar to labels of shelves and areas in a library. 
  Imagine stepping into a library, greeted by shelves neatly stacked with books. Now, envision these shelves as the visual hierarchy of a website's homepage. 
  The books placed at eye level in the library are akin to the primary content and key actions presented prominently on the website's landing page. 
  Just as these eye-level books are the most accessible and frequently sought, the critical content and primary user actions should be noticeable and easily accessible on the webpage. 
  On the other hand, books on higher or lower shelves in the library represent content of secondary importance, mirroring the placing of less crucial information in a well-structured hierarchy on the website.
   Much like a library's organized layout aids readers, a website's well-designed homepage helps users find what they need, providing a seamless experience without overwhelming users.</p>
