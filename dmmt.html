        <h3>Chapters 1-5</a></h3>
        <p>This was the first time I had ever been so painfully aware of how much happy talk is on a website. I made a
          map of a site I use every single day (Canvas), and the path that I follow to get to my desired task. Since the
          most frequent task I do on Canvas is downloading PDFs, I blurred out all of the irrelevant information in
          relation to my task.
          It highlights the importance of conciseness and simplicity in a design, trying to eliminate as much
          unnecessary content as possible.

        <h3>Chapters 6 and Colin Breck: Understanding Our Core Values: An Exercise for Individuals and Teams</a></h3>
        <strong> Word Journal</strong>
        <p> <s>Authenticity</s> Transparency
          Colin Breck writes to center a successful company around values, which brings colleagues together to focus on
          one, authentic, focus.
          He questioned the stereotypical portrayal of a leader, often involving confidence and boldness. Instead, he
          embraced a broader definition, one that connects with personal values and accepts vulnerability.
          He states that embodying values, not just talking about them, is what defines a true leader. After taking the
          time to identify his own values, Breck could be a more authentic leader and motivate others to do the same.
          Sharing his values with his team brought them closer and made a more cohesive work environment. Maybe the
          focus of values is less on authenticity, while it is still very important, but more on transparency — and
          sharing your needs and strengths with the people you surround yourself with.
          I took the time after reading to identify some of my key values and what aligns closest to my needs and work
          ethic: Empathy, Communication, and Creativity. I always look at situations from multiple perspectives, and
          feel the most successful when I am constantly sharing motivation and communication with my teammates.
          Creativity is an essential part of my values, without it I get burnt out easily and struggle to find a good
          reason to keep working, so I adjust to give myself a creative outlet when necessary to stay my most productive
          self.</p>

        <h3>Chapters 7</a></h3>
        <strong> Approximate Analogy</strong>
        <p>The hierarchy of a webpage is very similar to labels of shelves and areas in a library.
          Imagine stepping into a library, greeted by shelves neatly stacked with books. Now, envision these shelves as
          the visual hierarchy of a website's homepage.
          The books placed at eye level in the library are akin to the primary content and key actions presented
          prominently on the website's landing page.
          Just as these eye-level books are the most accessible and frequently sought, the critical content and primary
          user actions should be noticeable and easily accessible on the webpage.
          On the other hand, books on higher or lower shelves in the library represent content of secondary importance,
          mirroring the placing of less crucial information in a well-structured hierarchy on the website.
          Much like a library's organized layout aids readers, a website's well-designed homepage helps users find what
          they need, providing a seamless experience without overwhelming users.</p>

    <p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Efficiency</strong> <br>
      Efficiency is relevant to usability tests, focus groups, and do-it-yourself testing. In a focus group, you can
      gain
      insight to people’s reactions to new concepts and gauge their opinions on topics pertaining to your product or
      site.
      However, drawing out the process of discussion in focus groups is time consuming — so balancing the use of
      specific
      questions and follow up questions allow the participants to get straight to the point while still feeling like
      their
      voice is heard. In a usability test, Krug argues the most efficient manner of usability test is do-it-yourself
      testing. In this method, the expensive and complicated form of user testing is quickened for maximum feedback and
      repetition opportunities. Using smaller groups to test with and giving less tasks to the groups can shorten the
      time
      span. This method is used more frequently in the app development process than the traditional style of user
      testing,
      which allows for more modifications to the site based on user feedback before it is pushed out as a final product.

    <strong>Tutorial</strong>
    <p style="text-align: left;">
      <br>
      Krug describes how various checks of accessibility should be performed on a site, since many accessibility
      checkers
      are equivalent to “spell checkers”, they may catch the misuse or lack of alt text, but Krug describes a baseline
      before going further in depth for accessability testing. I have added the steps one can take to prove these
      actions
      will make a positive difference in the site’s functionality.
      <br>
      <br><strong>Add appropriate alt text to every image.</strong> Add an empty (or “null”) alt attribute (alt="") for
      images that
      screen readers should ignore, and add helpful, descriptive text for the rest.
      To learn how to write good alt text—and in fact to learn how to do any of the things in this list—head over to
      webaim.org. The folks at WebAIM have written excellent practical articles covering the nuts-and-bolts details of
      almost every accessibility technique. Once all have been added, go into the hosted site and inspect all images to
      verify the alt text is clearly available. Then check the site with images turned off in the accessability
      settings. If the site still functions as expected, congrats! You can move on to the next step.

      <br>
      <strong> Use headings correctly.</strong>
      The standard HTML heading elements convey useful information about the logical
      organization of your content to people using screen readers and make it easier for them to navigate via the
      keyboard. Use h1 for the page title or main content heading, h2 for the major section headings, h3 for
      subheadings, and so on, and then use CSS to redefine the visual appearance of each level. If you were to make a
      list of what information was most to least important, this can verify that the most important information is
      coordinated with the organizational structure being implemented with heading tags. If you showed the site to
      someone who had no idea how to use/ read the website, could they tell you the most important information just from
      the headings?

      <br>
      <strong>Make your forms work with screen readers:</strong>
      This largely boils down to using the HTML label element to
      associate the fields with their text labels, so people know what they’re supposed to enter. Try testing yourself
      with a screen reader, make sure that the information to enter is obvious and the input format won't conflict with
      a system's native auto-filling tendencies.

      <br>
      <strong> Put a “Skip to Main Content” link at the beginning of each page.</strong>
      Imagine having to spend 20 seconds (or a minute, or two) listening to the global navigation at the top
      of every page before you could look at the content. Test by listening yourself and accessing the skip to main
      content on each page, do a quick ctrl f and verify that it is present on every page that you can access. This is
      also a great time to make sure the information is presented in the order you want it to -- similar to the
      organizational structure from above.

      <br>
      <strong> Make all content accessible by keyboard.</strong> Remember, not everyone can use a mouse. Hotkeys can be
      incredibly helpful, as well as tab and the arrow keys to navigate and input information into the site. Practice
      vocal commands on your website as well.

      <br>
      <strong>Create significant contrast between your text and background.</strong>
      Don’t ever use light grey text on a dark grey background, for instance. There are plenty of extensions where you
      can visualize different types of colorblindness or color-impacting conditions. The colorblindness verifications
      are sometimes lacking, but going through each availability yourself double checks the accessability on your
      website.
