            <p class="blogtext"> This was the first time I had ever been so painfully aware of how much happy talk
                is on a website. I made a
                map of a site I use every single day (Canvas), and the path that I follow to get to my desired task.
                Since the
                most frequent task I do on Canvas is downloading PDFs, I blurred out all of the irrelevant
                information in
                relation to my task.
                It highlights the importance of conciseness and simplicity in a design, trying to eliminate as much
                unnecessary content as possible. </p>

            <p class="blogtext"> <s>Authenticity</s> Transparency
                Colin Breck writes to center a successful company around values, which brings colleagues together to
                focus on
                one, authentic, focus.
                He questioned the stereotypical portrayal of a leader, often involving confidence and boldness.
                Instead, he
                embraced a broader definition, one that connects with personal values and accepts vulnerability.
                He states that embodying values, not just talking about them, is what defines a true leader. After
                taking the
                time to identify his own values, Breck could be a more authentic leader and motivate others to do
                the same.
                Sharing his values with his team brought them closer and made a more cohesive work environment.
                Maybe the
                focus of values is less on authenticity, while it is still very important, but more on transparency
                — and
                sharing your needs and strengths with the people you surround yourself with.
                I took the time after reading to identify some of my key values and what aligns closest to my needs
                and work
                ethic: Empathy, Communication, and Creativity. I always look at situations from multiple
                perspectives, and
                feel the most successful when I am constantly sharing motivation and communication with my
                teammates.
                Creativity is an essential part of my values, without it I get burnt out easily and struggle to find
                a good
                reason to keep working, so I adjust to give myself a creative outlet when necessary to stay my most
                productive
                self. </p>

            <p class="blogtext"> The hierarchy of a webpage is very similar to labels of shelves and areas in a
                library.
                Imagine stepping into a library, greeted by shelves neatly stacked with books. Now, envision
                these shelves as
                the visual hierarchy of a website's homepage.
                The books placed at eye level in the library are akin to the primary content and key actions
                presented
                prominently on the website's landing page.
                Just as these eye-level books are the most accessible and frequently sought, the critical
                content and primary
                user actions should be noticeable and easily accessible on the webpage.
                On the other hand, books on higher or lower shelves in the library represent content of
                secondary importance,
                mirroring the placing of less crucial information in a well-structured hierarchy on the website.
                Much like a library's organized layout aids readers, a website's well-designed homepage helps
                users find what
                they need, providing a seamless experience without overwhelming users.</p>

            <p class="blogtext"> Efficiency is relevant to usability tests, focus groups, and do-it-yourself
                testing. In a focus group, you can
                gain
                insight to people’s reactions to new concepts and gauge their opinions on topics pertaining to
                your product or
                site.
                However, drawing out the process of discussion in focus groups is time consuming — so balancing
                the use of
                specific
                questions and follow up questions allow the participants to get straight to the point while
                still feeling like
                their
                voice is heard. In a usability test, Krug argues the most efficient manner of usability test is
                do-it-yourself
                testing. In this method, the expensive and complicated form of user testing is quickened for
                maximum feedback and
                repetition opportunities. Using smaller groups to test with and giving less tasks to the groups
                can shorten the
                time
                span. This method is used more frequently in the app development process than the traditional
                style of user
                testing,
                which allows for more modifications to the site based on user feedback before it is pushed out
                as a final product.

                Krug describes how various checks of accessibility should be performed on a site, since many
                accessibility
                checkers
                are equivalent to “spell checkers”, they may catch the misuse or lack of alt text, but Krug
                describes a baseline
                before going further in depth for accessability testing. I have added the steps one can take to
                prove these
                actions
                will make a positive difference in the site’s functionality.
                <br>
                <br><strong>Add appropriate alt text to every image.</strong> Add an empty (or “null”) alt
                attribute (alt="") for
                images that
                screen readers should ignore, and add helpful, descriptive text for the rest.
                To learn how to write good alt text—and in fact to learn how to do any of the things in this
                list—head over to
                webaim.org. The folks at WebAIM have written excellent practical articles covering the
                nuts-and-bolts details of
                almost every accessibility technique. Once all have been added, go into the hosted site and
                inspect all images to
                verify the alt text is clearly available. Then check the site with images turned off in the
                accessability
                settings. If the site still functions as expected, congrats! You can move on to the next step.

                <br>
                <strong> Use headings correctly.</strong>
                The standard HTML heading elements convey useful information about the logical
                organization of your content to people using screen readers and make it easier for them to
                navigate via the
                keyboard. Use h1 for the page title or main content heading, h2 for the major section headings,
                h3 for
                subheadings, and so on, and then use CSS to redefine the visual appearance of each level. If you
                were to make a
                list of what information was most to least important, this can verify that the most important
                information is
                coordinated with the organizational structure being implemented with heading tags. If you showed
                the site to
                someone who had no idea how to use/ read the website, could they tell you the most important
                information just from
                the headings?

                <br>
                <strong>Make your forms work with screen readers:</strong>
                This largely boils down to using the HTML label element to
                associate the fields with their text labels, so people know what they’re supposed to enter. Try
                testing yourself
                with a screen reader, make sure that the information to enter is obvious and the input format
                won't conflict with
                a system's native auto-filling tendencies.

                <br>
                <strong> Put a “Skip to Main Content” link at the beginning of each page.</strong>
                Imagine having to spend 20 seconds (or a minute, or two) listening to the global navigation at
                the top
                of every page before you could look at the content. Test by listening yourself and accessing the
                skip to main
                content on each page, do a quick ctrl f and verify that it is present on every page that you can
                access. This is
                also a great time to make sure the information is presented in the order you want it to --
                similar to the
                organizational structure from above.

                <br>
                <strong> Make all content accessible by keyboard.</strong> Remember, not everyone can use a
                mouse. Hotkeys can be
                incredibly helpful, as well as tab and the arrow keys to navigate and input information into the
                site. Practice
                vocal commands on your website as well.

                <br>
                <strong>Create significant contrast between your text and background.</strong>
                Don’t ever use light grey text on a dark grey background, for instance. There are plenty of
                extensions where you
                can visualize different types of colorblindness or color-impacting conditions. The
                colorblindness verifications
                are sometimes lacking, but going through each availability yourself double checks the
                accessability on your
                website.
