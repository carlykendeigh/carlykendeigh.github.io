        <h3>Chapter 6</a></h3>
        <strong>#Directed Analysis</strong>

        <p> I hate Outlook. I think it is poorly designed and incredibly frustrating.
          In these series of images, I have overlaid the "Rule of Thirds" grid described in Chapter 6 of Presentation
          Zen.
          I love rules and structure, and while designs are meant to intentionally break these rules, Outlook is
          horrible at breaking them impactfully.
          Nothing aligns with the visual appeal of the grids, I tried to cut Microsoft some slack by realigning the grid
          to where to content starts, but nothing is centered within a box, the subjects of the screen do not align in a
          box or powerpoint. They are either content that is painfully oversized or the icons are misaligned, unequally
          sized, or repetitive.
          But, while I have many issues with this platform (and I understand that presentation design and interface
          design have different use cases and rules), here are my main discomforts with the iPad app of Outlook:

        <h3>Chapter 2 and 4</a></h3>
        <strong>#Approximate Analogy</strong>
        <p>If you could really break it down, songs are very similar to presentations. Obviously presentations have
          multiple senses engaged (sight, sound, and -- at times -- audience participation), whereas music is typically
          only heard, but they share many key ideas in their creation and success. Chapter 2 discusses "Preparing,
          designing, and delivering a presentation is a creative act.", and songwriting is also a creative process. To
          be a breakthrough, hit single you need innovation in your music as to not bore your audience, similar to the
          open-mindedness necessary for successful presentations. But, most presentations and songs utilize storytelling
          and "stickiness"/ catchiness to help the audience better remember their content. Presentations follow an
          introduction of the topic (many times, an anecdote), an introduction to a problem, the proposed solution or
          research, and a conclusion. A song has a verse, chorus, second verse, repeated chorus, sometimes a bridge, and
          an outro. The structures might not be perfectly the same but have enough overlap to see the similarities.
          Successful presentations are credible, unexpected, and simple; in the music industry, think of Noah Kahan or
          Taylor Swift. Taylor Swift is now a global sensation, but she began as a creative songwriter who Tim McGraw
          gave credibility to -- which helped her get her feet under herself as an artist. She crossed genres and
          completely reinvented herself time and time again to grow in her music as she had in her life. Her most
          popular songs? Ones with catchy choruses and storytelling verses (Love Story, 22, Anti-Hero, Lover, etc.).
          Noah Kahan is a newer musical icon. Now being endorsed by artists like Hozier, Lizzy McAlpine, and Zach Bryan,
          his unique, folk style is renowned for the storytelling feel and emotional lyrics. His songs were unexpected
          compared to similar artists in the field, and that is part of the reason he is so successful. Artists craft
          music the way that CEOs, startups, or TEDxTalks speakers create presentations -- relying on creativity, points
          that stick, storytelling, and credibility.
