    <h5>#Directed Analysis</h5>

    <p> I hate Outlook. I think it is poorly designed and incredibly frustrating.
        In these series of images, I have overlaid the "Rule of Thirds" grid described in Chapter 6 of Presentation Zen.
        I love rules and structure, and while designs are meant to intentionally break these rules, Outlook is horrible at breaking them impactfully.
        Nothing aligns with the visual appeal of the grids, I tried to cut Microsoft some slack by realigning the grid to where to content starts, but nothing is centered within a box, the subjects of the screen do not align in a box or powerpoint. They are either content that is painfully oversized or the icons are misaligned, unequally sized, or repetitive.
        But, while I have many issues with this platform (and I understand that presentation design and interface design have different use cases and rules), here are my main discomforts with the iPad app of Outlook:
        <img  height="450" width="350" src="images/zenpost5.jpg" alt="outlook is poorly designed"/>
        <img  height="450" width="350" src="images/zenpost6.jpg" alt="outlook is poorly designed"/>
        <img  height="450" width="350" src="images/zenpost7.jpg" alt="outlook is poorly designed"/>
