            <p class="blogtext"> I hate Outlook. I think it is poorly designed and incredibly frustrating.
                In these series of images, I have overlaid the "Rule of Thirds" grid described in Chapter 6 of
                Presentation
                Zen.
                I love rules and structure, and while designs are meant to intentionally break these rules, Outlook is
                horrible at breaking them impactfully.
                Nothing aligns with the visual appeal of the grids, I tried to cut Microsoft some slack by realigning
                the grid
                to where to content starts, but nothing is centered within a box, the subjects of the screen do not
                align in a
                box or powerpoint. They are either content that is painfully oversized or the icons are misaligned,
                unequally
                sized, or repetitive.
                But, while I have many issues with this platform (and I understand that presentation design and
                interface
                design have different use cases and rules), here are my main discomforts with the iPad app of Outlook:

            <p class="blogtext">
                If you could really break it down, songs are very similar to presentations. Obviously presentations have
                multiple senses engaged (sight, sound, and -- at times -- audience participation), whereas music is
                typically
                only heard, but they share many key ideas in their creation and success. Chapter 2 discusses "Preparing,
                designing, and delivering a presentation is a creative act.", and songwriting is also a creative
                process. To
                be a breakthrough, hit single you need innovation in your music as to not bore your audience, similar to
                the
                open-mindedness necessary for successful presentations. But, most presentations and songs utilize
                storytelling
                and "stickiness"/ catchiness to help the audience better remember their content. Presentations follow an
                introduction of the topic (many times, an anecdote), an introduction to a problem, the proposed solution
                or
                research, and a conclusion. A song has a verse, chorus, second verse, repeated chorus, sometimes a
                bridge, and
                an outro. The structures might not be perfectly the same but have enough overlap to see the
                similarities.
                Successful presentations are credible, unexpected, and simple; in the music industry, think of Noah
                Kahan or
                Taylor Swift. Taylor Swift is now a global sensation, but she began as a creative songwriter who Tim
                McGraw
                gave credibility to -- which helped her get her feet under herself as an artist. She crossed genres and
                completely reinvented herself time and time again to grow in her music as she had in her life. Her most
                popular songs? Ones with catchy choruses and storytelling verses (Love Story, 22, Anti-Hero, Lover,
                etc.).
                Noah Kahan is a newer musical icon. Now being endorsed by artists like Hozier, Lizzy McAlpine, and Zach
                Bryan,
                his unique, folk style is renowned for the storytelling feel and emotional lyrics. His songs were
                unexpected
                compared to similar artists in the field, and that is part of the reason he is so successful. Artists
                craft
                music the way that CEOs, startups, or TEDxTalks speakers create presentations -- relying on creativity,
                points
                that stick, storytelling, and credibility.
