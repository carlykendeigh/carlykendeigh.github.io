            <p class="blogtext">Breaking down some of my favorite quotes from the chapter: “It
                is
                time to reverse
                the situation: to cast the
                blame upon the machines and their design.” “Cognition and emotion are tightly intertwined, which means
                that
                the designers must design with both in mind.” “It is not our duty to understand the arbitrary,
                meaningless
                dictates of machines…You are designing for people the way you would like them to be, not for the way
                they
                really are” “Consider a pair of scissors: you can see that the number of possible actions is limited.“
                “It
                doesn't matter how good a product is if, in the end, nobody uses it.” These quotes are incredibly
                validating
                as someone who has been deemed “common sense stupid” their entire life. Especially being someone who is
                left-handed, I encounter – almost daily – difficulty interacting with products. My mom and I frequently
                find
                ourselves pushing pull doors, clicking an imaginary “x” button on the right when it appears on the left,
                and
                constantly clicking “forgot my password” when the autofill fails us. I am only beginning my journey as a
                designer, and already know that people will use a product how they initially think they should, not how
                the
                designer necessarily has told them to do so. I particularly have an issue with scissors. Yes, I know
                that
                right-handed people probably have a more streamlined understanding of how to intuitively use and hold a
                pair
                of scissors. But I have always been told I was doing it “wrong”. No, I’m holding them with my dominant
                hand,
                why would you trust someone to hold a potentially hazardous object in their non-dominant hand? Much less
                in a
                child’s non-dominant hand? And don’t get me started on left-handed scissors. Schoolteachers have enough
                to
                worry about and purchase outside of their allotted budget that doesn’t account for the 10% of students
                who
                have to hold scissors upside down and backward, and even if they do have them, most lefties have grown
                up
                accommodating so it’s a useless gesture. Accessibility extends to dominant hands, apparently. The quote
                regarding cognition and emotions combination was also validating to me, since in the CS field I am
                embarrassed
                to be as openly empathetic as I am. Engineers are known for their data-based analytics, their calculated
                steps, and their strategy. I am known for my energetic personality, my highly-saturated emotional
                capacity,
                and that if you play a dog commercial I will cry. I want my designs to include emotion, otherwise, why
                design
                at all? I want to make people’s lives better, faster, easier, and I am passionate about that. If
                designers
                operate purely on function or purely on feeling the design is dysfunctional, but balancing the needs of
                both
                can make a highly intuitive product. At the end of the day, designers’ jobs exist to make products that
                improve the lives of others. The use of and reaction to these products determines whether a designer’s
                ideas
                were effective in communicating the intended affordances of the design.</p>

                <strong>Metacognition: “Thinking about thinking”</strong>
                <br>
                Metacognition is easily my favorite word, but perfectly applies to this chapter. The dictionary
                definition, to
                give some better context, is “awareness and understanding of one's own thought processes”. I loved the
                psychological perspectives in this chapter, I discuss learned helplessness often and wish the author had
                touched on the mere-exposure effect. That effect means the more exposure you have to something, the more
                you
                naturally enjoy it – think of an “aquired taste” towards coffee or broccoli. The more you have to deal
                with an
                inconvenient design, the more a user may become accustomed to it, even if it is initially so
                frustrating.
                Designers have to be aware of the psychology of their customers as well as the psychology they
                experience,
                Thinking about the mental processes involved in everyday decisions can significantly improve the
                effectiveness
                and ease of use of a design.

                I have always thought it was rude that video games didn’t come with every little
                movement instruction. How am I supposed to know that the right trigger means shield and crouch but the
                left trigger opens inventory
                when the
                only written instruction was “Press X to jump, try using the controller to move left and right. There
                are
                certain constraints that avid players pick up over time that inexperienced players don’t recognize
                immediately.
                Logical constraints play a part, you can’t attack NPCs in most games, or jump off of surfaces that
                aren’t
                intended to be jumped off of. Semantic constraints, for example, in a first-person shooter game, might
                dictate
                that players can reload their weapon when it's empty, reflecting the real-world logic of reloading a
                firearm.
                For cultural constraints, many games try to match the cultural norms of their time period and location.
                Assassin’s Creed does this very well, having culturally appropriate clothing and building styles. For
                physical
                constraints, think of sports simulations like "FIFA," where physical constraints apply to player
                movements, ball physics, and interactions between athletes. Players must understand and adapt to these
                constraints to
                perform well in the virtual sports environment. </p>
