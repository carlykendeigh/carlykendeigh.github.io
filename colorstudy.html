                <Strong>Original Design: </Strong>
                The color scheme of the original design is almost triadic. There are heavy influences of yellow-orange,
                red-violet, and blue-green, which are a triad on the color wheel. However, the frequent use of blue and
                navy
                offset the triadic scheme and make the colors less cohesive together.
                <br>The personality of the original website is overwhelming to users because of the lack of uniformity.
                Well,
                the blues and greens played very well into the calming and energetic balance that the company stands
                for, the
                new flavor, being a golden yellow accent on many of the pages made for an uncomfortable color transition
                that
                I think the design was ill prepared for. The designers want their consumers to feel refreshed, trendy,
                and
                healthy, which the blue green and purples played very well into, whereas the yellow brought a bubbly
                vibrancy
                that didn't match the vibe of the rest of the page, despite it being a great color on its own to
                represent the
                youthfulness of the companyâ€™s values.
                <br>

                <br>
                <Strong>Redo 1: </Strong>
                The first review shows a triadic color combination, which was what we because of the And red violet
                there are
                two tertiary colors with a blue instead of the blue green to be the official triadic. However, it does
                create
                a better sense of unity and cohesiveness than the original combination. There is a strong focus on the
                blue
                and red violets with yellow orange, being the accent color to show the new flavor, which is very similar
                to
                the original design.
                <br>Of this scheme is a blend of professionalism and authenticity, which, in itself is an interesting
                dynamic.
                The sophistication and classiness of purple meets the emotional and tranquil, blues, to create a balance
                of
                stability and luxury, in the eye of the consumer, the red violet tones with the yellow provide a sense
                of
                slight complementary Where the accent draw the eye to the new product rather than having it blend in
                with the
                background. This scheme is much more calming and relaxing than the original, vibrant and overwhelming
                layout.
                <br>
                <img src="images/cs2.JPG" class="blogpicblog"  alt="color study image" />
                <br>
                <Strong>Redo 2: </Strong>
                The second redo is analogous using yellow orange to green tones, focusing on the vibrancy and
                playfulness of
                the yellows and greens.This dynamic is an eye catching golden yellow with warm and vibrant qualities,
                combining with the burst
                of fresh, natural energy from the green, which played together very nicely, since they are so close on
                the
                color wheel, and create a feeling of excitement, youthfulness, and vitality that leans into the health
                mindset
                of the company.
                <br>
                <img src="images/cs3.JPG"class="blogpicblog"  alt="color study image" />
                <br>
                <Strong>Redo 3: </Strong>
                The third redo is also analogous, but using reds to oranges, playing into that warmer color scheme
                compared to
                the very cool toned original page which changes the emotional response that the page would evoke.
                <br>The pink Sun combination brings serenity and illusions to a sunset, as well as bringing joy,
                optimism and
                relaxation. These colors are more associated with positivity and happiness, rather than simply
                tranquility and
                peacefulness the pink can symbolize something sensitive whereas the yellow can focus on the vibrancy and
                cheerfulness of the website. The balance between these two separate forces combined into a joyful,
                slightly
                romantic vibe that the product can adhere to.
                <br>
                <img src="images/cs4.JPG" class="blogpicblog"  alt="color study image" />
                <br>
                <Strong>Redo 4: </Strong>
                The fourth redo uses a complementary color scheme, focusing on pinks and greens, which fall into the red
                and
                green sectors of the color wheel. My goal redesign was to avoid the feeling of colors are also in
                contrast
                that Wood would draw the audiences attention.
                <br>The green is very earthy and natural bringing the customer to think of the products as organic and
                clean.
                Seeing as it is a health drink company, and the pink plays into the vibrant and intimate size of a
                customers
                mindset, giving them a deep sense of connection to the website. Dichotomy of opposite colors next to
                each
                other also plays an interesting role in where the viewer is looking. Between the colors attribute to the
                original color scheme that fades from blue into a soft green, but takes away the tranquility and slow
                calm
                that Blue brings and replaces it with a high energy rooted in a deep green.
