          <Strong>Original Design: </Strong>
          The color scheme of the original design is almost triadic. There are heavy influences of yellow-orange,
          red-violet, and blue-green, which are a triad on the color wheel. However, the frequent use of blue and navy
          offset the triadic scheme and make the colors less cohesive together.
          <br>The personality of the original website is overwhelming to users because of the lack of uniformity. Well,
          the blues and greens played very well into the calming and energetic balance that the company stands for, the
          new flavor, being a golden yellow accent on many of the pages made for an uncomfortable color transition that
          I think the design was ill prepared for. The designers want their consumers to feel refreshed, trendy, and
          healthy, which the blue green and purples played very well into, whereas the yellow brought a bubbly vibrancy
          that didn't match the vibe of the rest of the page, despite it being a great color on its own to represent the
          youthfulness of the companyâ€™s values.
