<h3>Instructions:</h3>
<p>Identify the two core values for your UI. Write a few sentences about each one and
why they are especially relevant to your UI</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Empathy</strong>
  <span="c2 c1">: The sole purpose of
    DOT is For users
    to finally have a way to get separate components of their lives into one easily digestible and clearly
    formatted
    dashboard. As someone who highly values empathy in my own life, it was very important to me that empathy
    transferred to my website. I want users to know that the creator of the website has gone through the
    struggles
    they feel every day when trying to organize their hectic schedule and that making their life easier is my
    main
    goal.
</li>
<li><strong>Transparency:</strong> So often it feels like interfaces
  are to make the information you need difficult
  to find. The goal of DOT is to clearly communicate the day's itinerary to the user; combining a
  calendar view with a task list that finds a connection between physical and digital planning. The site will
  be
  easy to understand and navigate, giving users the control and transparency that they are looking for.
</li>
</ul>
<br>
<p>Explain how you will express that core value in your UI. You need at least 3
strategies per value (copy, colors, signifiers, etc. can all count as strategies, but they are by no means a
comprehensive list).</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Signifier</strong>: My website will utilize icons
  that have clearly stated alternative text, so the purpose of each button is very simple. to get back to
  the main dashboard, the users will click on the logo. to see the calendar view, the usual click on the
  calendar.
  to make a new scan, users click on the plus button. if the user needs to access their settings or log out,
  there
  are two buttons; one that looks like a gear and the other the word "logout", respectively.
  having signifiers that can be used by all types of users emphasizes the empathetic and transparent values of
  the
  site.</li>
<li> <strong>Multiple Calendar Views:</strong> Not everyone likes
  to look at their schedule the same way. some weeks are too busy to only look one day at a time, because of
  this
  the users can access all of their tasks and events that they want to look at in three different formats
  (day,
  week, month). This gives them a feeling of personalization and a higher sense of control since they get
  to
  customize how they view their content without having to put in too much work to change the layout. being
  able
  to
  scan multiple types of physical, analog calendars, planners, habit trackers, to-do lists, and whatever else
  the
  user could need easily allows them to get the personalized view that makes looking at the upcoming tasks as
  simple and stress-free as possible.</li>
<li><strong>Copy:</strong>
  All text you within the DOT
  interface
  is highly intentional. while there are tool tips and instructions varied throughout the site the majority of
  the
  text should always be the user-specific content and not DOT instructions. This interface is truly the
  means between a user and their schedule, and will not be used for advertising its own interests or agendas.
  therefore most of the copy text in the site is determined by the user rather than myself. the text is
  whatever
  they have going on that day (or week or month), rather than what <i> I</i>want them to feel. </li>
</ul>
<p>Develop a list of all the pages that would likely be included in a full version
of
your UI. Think critically about how your users will navigate your UI for all their tasks. By making this list,
you
are not committing to building these pages, but you will include the page titles in the mockup of your
navigation
menu.</p>
<ul>
<li>Login</li>
<li>Register </li>
<li>Initial preferences page</li>
<li>Dashboard month view, week view, day view</li>
<li>Dot page: tasks &amp; events for today</li>
<li>New scan upload</li>
<li>Settings &amp; preferences</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>Arrange those pages into a sensical navigation tree. For the sake of this
assignment,
you can use outline style to display the nesting. Bold the pages you actually plan to build.
