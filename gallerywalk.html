                        </a></h3>
                </div>

            <h3 class="blogtype">Background & Research
            </h3>
            <p class="blogtext">
                We naturally identify faces and instantly respond emotionally to the faces we recognize.
                If you recognize a friend, your brain responds positively, if you see a mean stranger you may respond
                with
                fear or anger
                The skill to recognize faces is developed as infants and develops over a lifetime
                In infants, the FFA may not show the same level of specialization, but it refines and becomes more
                distinct
                as they gain more experience with faces, suggesting a learning and developmental component in its
                functionality.
                <br> <br> The Fusiform Face Area is a small section of the brain near the base of the skull that
                responds more
                strongly to faces than other objects.
                It is believed the FFA is specialized in identifying faces due to this
                There have been recently disproven hypotheses that FFA prefers smoothed objects (spheres, etc) over
                objects
                with corners (blocks, pyramids, etc.)
                <br> <br>Recently noted that the same area of the brain is activated in individuals who have been blind
                since
                birth and feel a 3-D model of a face
                FFA is not limited to visual or physical cues to be activated, hence it’s disconnection from the visual
                cortex in the brain
                <br> Facial recognition involves a network of brain regions, including OFA, FFA, and STS
                The occipital face area (OFA), superior temporal sulcus (STS), and amygdala all contribute to different
                aspects of facial processing
                Aspects of facial processing include facial features, emotional expression interpretation, and
                associating
                emotions with recognized faces.
                <br> <br>Research indicates that abnormalities or impairments in the Fusiform Face Area are associated
                with
                various neurological conditions.
                For example, individuals with prosopagnosia (the inability to recognize familiar faces) often show
                anomalies
                in the FFA
                This implies that other neurological conditions may also be linked to FFA and, in turn, have a
                connection to
                facial recognition issues
            </p>

            <h3 class="blogtype">Key Takeaways:
            </h3>

            <p class="blogtext"> When using images on interfaces, the subjects of the photo will be quickly recognized
                as a face, engaging the FFA
                This means in websites/ applications, be conscious of how user’s knee-jerk reaction to an image may
                affect their opinion of the site (using a controversial celebrity as a key branding point crating
                unpleasant emotions)
                <br> <br> Faces may be distracting in interfaces since an entire part of our brain is constantly
                scanning for
                other faces to recognize
                <br> <br> Too many subjects may draw attention away from the content and towards the images
                (particularly when the
                images are not the focus of the page)
                This could be considered an accessibility concern.
                Instead of identifying pages by faces (if a certain character/actor’s image is being used as a link to
                another page), allow for multiple forms of identification such as patterns or symbols - similar to the
                accommodations for colorblindness
            </p>

            <h3 class="blogtype">Celebrity Connection
            </h3>

            <p class="blogtext">
                Brad Pitt, a prominent Hollywood actor, has openly discussed his struggle with prosopagnosia, a
                condition also known as face blindness, which impairs his ability to recognize faces. The condition is
                associated with challenges in the fusiform face area (FFA) of the brain, a region specialized for facial
                recognition. In Pitt's case, this condition presents a struggle that goes beyond occasional social
                discomfort. It impacts his personal and professional life, creating barriers in forming and maintaining
                relationships. Recognizing fellow actors, crewmembers, or interviewers he has met before or
                distinguishing between different individuals can be perplexing and socially awkward. This neurological
                condition has prompted Pitt to adopt coping strategies, like focusing on other unique features or
                contextual cues (hair, sound of voice, etc.). His willingness to openly discuss his experiences with
                prosopagnosia raises awareness about the condition, offering support to others who may share similar
                challenges.
