                This portfolio has been the biggest learning experience for my UI knowledge. Not only did I learn and
                reflect on UI concepts from readings and in-class engagement, I wanted to create a portfolio completely
                from scratch — no templates, no prepicked colors, all HTML/ CSS and all through trial and error. While
                there are a few things about the portfolio I wish would have been done better, those functionalities
                don’t affect the list of requirements for the project.
                <br> <br>
                <strong>Navigation</strong>
                At the top of every page is the navbar that can redirect users to the top of the home page, my “about
                me” section, portfolio, and blog. In the portfolio section, there are signifiers to what each project
                looks like and drop shadows to indicate the boxes are clickable. On hover you can see the green that
                matches the color scheme is clickable, the boxes that are not yet finished (“under construction”) are
                labeled with text to show they cannot be clicked on, since they turn red on the hover and red-green
                colorblindness would not be able to detect a difference between the hover states they can rely on the
                text. The portfolio and blog pages are set up similarly so when you scroll to the bottom you can see
                which page you are on indicated by the darker green color, class of the div saying “you are here”. You
                can get to any blog page from another blog, portfolio functions similarly but since the design narrative
                is the only project completed as of now, the others don’t click but once they are fully built out will
                work the same.
                <br> <br>
                <strong> Colors</strong>
                Originally, I wanted my site to be white and pink, purely because pink is my favorite color. But as I
                was putting a site together in Figma, pink and white didn’t have enough contrast to be easily read. One
                of the pictures I had considered including of myself at the top of my page had a lot of green
                undertones, so I based the color scheme around that. I think the black for the site is actually an
                eyedropper sample of my hair, the green was taken from the original background behind me that ended up
                being cut from the final site, the light green was a sample from my shorts. The color scheme seems
                simple enough, but all revolves around that photo of me on the landing page, giving the site a cohesive
                feel — the green reflects nature, growth, and balance. The site uses a combination of dark grey
                backgrounds and light text contrasted with light green backgrounds and a forest green title to separate
                sections uniquely and still feeling like a single page.
                <br> <br>
                <strong> Affordances and Signifiers</strong>
                Send most of my site is blog posts and information about things that I have completed. There are less
                signifiers than other websites that we have practiced designing, however, the site is incredibly user
                interactive. The signifiers on the blog grid show all of the different option users can click on, but
                once they are hovered on the color of the background changes, indicating it is applicable, and can be
                seen as a signifier to get to that page. All buttons have some sort of indicator, whether it be the
                cursor changing, or the background color changing slightly to indicate that a button is clickable. The
                site is not overwhelming and the amount of things to click on since there is lots of clickable space at
                the top giving information and with each blog post, the only items that lead you other pages are on the
                very bottom.
                Accessibility. I mentioned previously that the color choice was interesting to work with because I had
                to consider that the compliment of green was not going to be as simple to integrate as it may be for
                other color options since people with red green color blindness an additional indicator, such as text or
                icons. Since it was my first HTMLCSS website not know the best way to import icons, so I relied on many
                pictures using relevant, alternate text, and text indicators. I also made sure text was large enough
                that my parents could both see the site without grabbing their reading glasses :)
                <br> <br>
                <strong> Usability and Pagination </strong>
                Several blog post had multiple paragraphs of information, I found the best way to put this up, would be
                with paragraphs being divided by bold headings, and on occasion bulled lists. When designing the format
                for the blogs, I made sure that these forms of content while different from some of the other pages are
                still, easy to follow and continue the navigational hierarchy. I pages when content got too crowded,
                each blog book is on a different page, since grouping by book, rather than concept, felt like I could
                better organize the relationship between the posts. Information about my personal UI Journey are on the
                cover page, the exception being my résumé.
                <br> <br>
                <strong> Evidence of evolution </strong>
                Before this project had only built one website using HTML CSS, and that was in seventh grade. I started
                with a template that frustrated me because of its lack of personalization. I’m sure I knew more about
                website building at the time I could’ve worked with it, but I learned infinitely more from having to
                create my own site. The most frustrating part of the process was resizing and getting to load the way I
                wanted. There were pieces of building a website that I never considered. Most of the semester, my
                portfolio looked like it was under construction. I spent a full day of fall break, and a full day of
                Thanksgiving break, dedicated to redesigning my portfolio to my liking. Figma dev mode was able to give
                me proportions in Ram, but I eventually learned that using the viewport ratios would be more successful.
                I learned the easier way to do things after facing trial and error doing at the hard way.
                <br> <br>
                <strong> Proper attribution of others' work </strong>
                All blog posts that come from a reading, have the chapter and author name at the top of the blog post,
                this includes our medium readings, and YouTube videos. In the color study project, I attribute the
                website to which I was redesigning so readers would know that it was not my original idea.
                <br> <br>
                <strong> Intentional integration of your values</strong>
                I value Empathy and creativity, which I think is highly prevalent through the site. Creativity is shown
                in my image at the top or the circle in the NAV bar, but also in how I choose to create my projects and
                reflect on them. My site is relatively easy to navigate, but more importantly, shows an authentic
                reflection of myself as an empathetic person. I want it to be easier for other people to put themselves
                in my shoes without discrediting the work that I’ve done.
                <br> <br>

                I have had such a great semester learning in this class and I am grateful to have found a passion and
                career path from it!! Thank you for everything! Have a great break
