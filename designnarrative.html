                <h3>Design Narrative</h3>

                <p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Inspiration for DOT:</strong>
                    <br> I created DOT to be a solution for my personal life. I have struggled with staying on top of tasks
                    and events my whole life, and have had to get creative in finding ways to ensure I get everything
                    done on time. I have tried physical planners, Google Calendars, and writing on the back of my hand,
                    but nothing was working. The best system I have created is Google Calendar plus a physical to-do
                    list. After consulting some close friends I realized that so many people have a similar struggle. I
                    knew I wanted to combine multiple productivity platforms by using camera scans and uploads to create
                    digital events, an idea I got from my mother. The “dots” concept on every page came from my
                    roommate, Ella, who really liked the idea of a digital bullet journal. I needed a solution for
                    myself but then began catering the experience of DOT to other people. As someone who struggles in
                    managing my tasks, I figured that I would be a good base user to test the designs on. I worked alone
                    throughout this project. While any designer may be capable of creating a calendar/to-do list, not
                    every designer would create it with the intention of being empathetic, fun, and keeping content from
                    getting overwhelming. This app has been embraced by people in my life with neurodivergence, and
                    while it benefits everyone, I especially want this app to be neurodivergent-friendly. As an ADHDer
                    myself, I had plenty of experience and dopamine training to draw on in developing this application.
                    DOT will improve the productivity levels of users once they are able to clearly visualize what tasks
                    they have ahead of them, users will be more successful in their academic and career work, and feel
                    more at peace because they will spend less time planning out their day and more time knocking out
                    their tasks. DOT exists to be a stress-reliever for hardworking individuals who overwork themselves,
                    it is the resource they need to

                    <strong>Why Desktop?:</strong>
                    <br> I am on my laptop most of the day, especially when doing productive tasks for school or work. Having
                    my “home base” be in desktop format made sense for being the balancing point for working users. I
                    would like to also create versions available on mobile, and watch to allow for on-the-go check-ins
                    of daily tasks.

                    <strong>Story Inspired by UI:</strong>
                    <br> My story that fueled this product was based around Josie, a college student who balances her class
                    schedule with her on-campus job as a journalist for the Daily Nebraskan. She is optimistic and
                    motivated but finds it incredibly difficult to keep track of everything that needs to be done.
                    Having recently been elected as social chair for her sorority, Josie is becoming more overwhelmed
                    and confused by her planners, calendars, and to-do lists every day. She is comfortable enough with
                    technology since she uses it in her classes and profession, but likes to use it as a reference
                    rather than her main focus as a paper planner. However, all of Josie’s school and work assignments
                    come through on digital calendars, making her have to take the time to transfer them over. DOT is
                    the solution for those like Josie. DOT takes a scan of her physical planner she takes so much care
                    in making and recognizes the handwriting to convert each task, event, and color-coded highlight to a
                    digital format where her calendars can be seen in a succinct format. When DOT doesn't just save time
                    for Josie; it restores balance to her life. Josie sits down to do her work for the day, she can pull
                    up DOT to see the tasks and events coming soonest and what she has to look forward to at the end of
                    the week. The satisfaction of popping a bubble after completing a task and seeing the amount of work
                    she has accomplished in her day is the most rewarding experience from DOT, giving users the time
                    back they desperately need to take care of themselves. For Josie, DOT becomes more than just a
                    productivity tool – it becomes a personal assistant tailored to her needs. With DOT, Josie not only
                    gains efficiency in managing her academic and social commitments but also enjoys the luxury of
                    allocating time for self-care – a factor often neglected in the life of a college student.

                    <br>You describe your process of creating the design system, highlighting a few choices (a few colors,
                    your fonts, why you rounded only one corner on buttons, etc.). You do not need to justify every
                    decision, just the ones you see are the most important and/or the ones you're proudest to
                    contribute.
                    <br> Colors
                    My color scheme is very neutral and warm, it is meant to be comforting and calming, pleasant without
                    being boring.
