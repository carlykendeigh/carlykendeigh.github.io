                    <strong>Inspiration for DOT:</strong>
                    <br> I created DOT to be a solution for my personal life. I have struggled with staying on top of
                    tasks
                    and events my whole life, and have had to get creative in finding ways to ensure I get everything
                    done on time. I have tried physical planners, Google Calendars, and writing on the back of my hand,
                    but nothing was working. The best system I have created is Google Calendar plus a physical to-do
                    list. After consulting some close friends I realized that so many people have a similar struggle. I
                    knew I wanted to combine multiple productivity platforms by using camera scans and uploads to create
                    digital events, an idea I got from my mother. The “dots” concept on every page came from my
                    roommate, Ella, who really liked the idea of a digital bullet journal. I needed a solution for
                    myself but then began catering the experience of DOT to other people. As someone who struggles in
                    managing my tasks, I figured that I would be a good base user to test the designs on. I worked alone
                    throughout this project. While any designer may be capable of creating a calendar/to-do list, not
                    every designer would create it with the intention of being empathetic, fun, and keeping content from
                    getting overwhelming. This app has been embraced by people in my life with neurodivergence, and
                    while it benefits everyone, I especially want this app to be neurodivergent-friendly. As an ADHDer
                    myself, I had plenty of experience and dopamine training to draw on in developing this application.
                    DOT will improve the productivity levels of users once they are able to clearly visualize what tasks
                    they have ahead of them, users will be more successful in their academic and career work, and feel
                    more at peace because they will spend less time planning out their day and more time knocking out
                    their tasks. DOT exists to be a stress-reliever for hardworking individuals who overwork themselves,
                    it is the resource they need to
                    <br><br>
                    <strong>Why Desktop?:</strong>
                    <br> I am on my laptop most of the day, especially when doing productive tasks for school or work.
                    Having
                    my “home base” be in desktop format made sense for being the balancing point for working users. I
                    would like to also create versions available on mobile, and watch to allow for on-the-go check-ins
                    of daily tasks.
                    <br><br>
                    <strong>Story Inspired by UI:</strong>
                    <br> My story that fueled this product was based around Josie, a college student who balances her
                    class
                    schedule with her on-campus job as a journalist for the Daily Nebraskan. She is optimistic and
                    motivated but finds it incredibly difficult to keep track of everything that needs to be done.
                    Having recently been elected as social chair for her sorority, Josie is becoming more overwhelmed
                    and confused by her planners, calendars, and to-do lists every day. She is comfortable enough with
                    technology since she uses it in her classes and profession, but likes to use it as a reference
                    rather than her main focus as a paper planner. However, all of Josie’s school and work assignments
                    come through on digital calendars, making her have to take the time to transfer them over. DOT is
                    the solution for those like Josie. DOT takes a scan of her physical planner she takes so much care
                    in making and recognizes the handwriting to convert each task, event, and color-coded highlight to a
                    digital format where her calendars can be seen in a succinct format. When DOT doesn't just save time
                    for Josie; it restores balance to her life. Josie sits down to do her work for the day, she can pull
                    up DOT to see the tasks and events coming soonest and what she has to look forward to at the end of
                    the week. The satisfaction of popping a bubble after completing a task and seeing the amount of work
                    she has accomplished in her day is the most rewarding experience from DOT, giving users the time
                    back they desperately need to take care of themselves. For Josie, DOT becomes more than just a
                    productivity tool – it becomes a personal assistant tailored to her needs. With DOT, Josie not only
                    gains efficiency in managing her academic and social commitments but also enjoys the luxury of
                    allocating time for self-care – a factor often neglected in the life of a college student.

                    <br><br>
                    <strong>Creating the Design System:</strong>
                    <br>
                    <br> <strong>Colors</strong>
                    My color scheme is very neutral and warm, it is meant to be comforting and calming, pleasant without
                    being boring. The brown tones are meant to be calming similar to colors of wood and sand, which are
                    earthy and familiar to all users. Most of the shades of brown on the paint actually variations of
                    the same shade with different opacities over white, I did this because I had a hard time finding
                    color combinations that were complementary with brown, a lot of the shades were too green for my
                    liking, and it looked sickly.


                    <br><strong>Fonts</strong>
                    The majority of the app uses the open sand font, which is a sans-style font. Very clear to read on
                    digital formatting, but also with big enough letters that were spaced out far enough to be easily
                    read as the text got smaller. The accent font is Abril Fatface, which, as the name so jokingly
                    suggests, has very thick down, strokes in a slightly slightly fun house font. This is only used for
                    the names of dates and months in the app. This is one of the only things the user is not in control
                    of their schedule everything that they actually add to their app should be completely easy to read.
                    Items that don’t change such as the month or the date or in the fancier font because they will be
                    looked at slightly less.


                    <br><strong> Lowercase Test</strong>
                    The entirety of this app is in lowercase, except for the events added in by each user. This is to
                    reinforce the idea that the app is calming and easy to digest. The events that users input will be
                    in whatever case they choose to write or type, but the content on the app is all lowercase.


                    <br> <strong>Round Components</strong>
                    In a similar fashion to the round, sans font, the buttons throughout the application have rounded
                    corners. The rounded corners on components are relative to the size of the component, so they all
                    have the same “percentage” of roundness. Even the icons for tasks and calendars have round corners
                    or circles. The lack of sharp corners and edges also adds to the pleasant and relaxing aura of the
                    app.


                    <br><strong> Dots</strong>
                    Since the purpose of the app is “Done On Time” or DOT, having the dots on every page outside of the
                    logo was very important to me. The lining of each hour block in the app is lined with dots instead
                    of consecutive lines.

                <p class="blogtext">
                    <br><br> <strong>Colleague Assessment:</strong>
                    <br> After having our class look over my program and give their feedback, we were given an
                    assignment to collect the most important and frequently occurring issues, the issues with DOT were
                    as follows:
                    <br>Inconsistent Calendar Wording: The use of “paper” and “planner” interchangeably has caused
                    usability issues, implying that all paper calendars were weekly view todo list planners – changing
                    the verbiage to analyze analog vs digital, and separating scans then by day, week, or month will
                    make the process simpler to follow.
                    <br>Dots Alignment In Dashboard: The site’s motif is a “dot” on the page, referencing its namesake
                    of Done on Time – however the dots serve no real purpose in their design as of now. They almost
                    align with the numbering of hours on the side, but fail to do so consistently. Remaking the dot
                    sections so they help users keep track of hourly commitments will improve the ease of use of the
                    site.
                    <br>Calendar Side Buttons: The side buttons on the calendar view can add events or upload scans, but
                    since events are added from third-party calendars and scans have a whole other page to be uploaded
                    from, their purpose is unnecessary there and they just take up space and confuse users.
                    <br>Scan Button Redundancy: On the scan page, there are two clickable buttons to upload an image,
                    and afterward you are presented with how to categorize it. If the only purpose of the scan page is
                    to add a picture, you should be automatically directed to the upload view without needing 2
                    additional clicks.
                    <br>The strengths in the prototype were in it’s color scheme and general usability. It took my
                    classmates very little time to understand the concepts of the app and to see it’s purposes.
                    <br>I first redesigned the dot alignment and calendar side buttons since they were easier fixes.
                    Then I created a dashboard outline but didn’t implement it until after my user tests so I could see
                    which features impacted potential “every day users” the most and cater to their needs as well.

                    <br><br>
                    <strong>User Tests:</strong>
                    <br>

                    For the user tests, I had my two college-aged testers who are overwhelmed with their current
                    work/life balance try DOT and complete two tasks: locate your calendar and next event, and upload a
                    scan of your planner (without actually taking a photo). I mostly followed the testing script from
                    Steve Krug’s Rocket Surgery Made Easy. The findings of these tests showed that the theme amongst
                    users was it wasn’t unique enough. The functionings of the calendar were simple enough to
                    understand, but the steps to take to get past that were hard to follow. Redesigning the dashboard
                    after my first set of user interviews allowed for positive changes to be seen once I remet with
                    these users later.
                    <br>Here are some of the issues that I have since changed, but noticed most predominantly in the
                    user tests.
                    <br>
                    New User Dashboard: Having a combined view of the tasks and calendar events gives a cohesive view to
                    the user of the entirety of the day rather than two different sections. This dashboard takes away a
                    lot of the complications that occurred from the calendar view alone and should significantly reduce
                    the number of clicks it takes to complete the happy path.
                    <br>Edit and add specific events without calendar upload: Events are not set in stone in a regular
                    calendar and should be able to be changed, so the same should be available to DOT users. even though
                    the original events come from the upload scan making edits to the event name or time as well as
                    adding a new event to a specific calendar or separately gives a more human experience to the app.
                    <br>Redesign upload image page: The upload page has proven to be very difficult for users to
                    navigate through user tests, and it's confusing layout needs to be updated so it is clear what task
                    needs to be completed. Changing the button sizes to be more reasonable making it feel more cohesive
                    with the rest of the website and giving specific directions as to what comes next eliminates the
                    feeling of “is it working?” or “is it doing what I expected?”.
                    <br>Click the DOT logo for the dashboard view, and the calendar button for the calendar view:
                    Cooking the logo should always bring you back to the homepage and since I did not have a set
                    homepage before this process, redirecting users to the dashboard instead of the calendar view which
                    was a redundant button click will prove to be a lot more useful.
                    <br>Update the color scheme of the app to be less distracting and have higher contrast: This
                    particular issue I found interesting, especially after the inclusive design workshops that we had
                    been doing in class, I realized my users need a lot more contrast to see what information is
                    important versus irrelevant, and that my original color scheme was very cozy but not very productive
                    and the purpose of being done on time is to be more productive.
                    <br>Create a registration page: This feels like a given, but must have been an oversight. especially
                    when doing user tests, these users have never experienced the site before and when you encounter a
                    new website and you need an account to get in the first thing you do is make an account so giving
                    the users a registration page to do exactly that is a very basic need I can meet.

                    <strong>Values: Empathy and Transparency</strong>
                    <br>
                    <strong>Empathy:</strong> The sole purpose of DOT is For users to finally have a way to get separate
                    components of
                    their lives into one easily digestible and clearly formatted dashboard. As someone who highly values
                    empathy in my own life, it was very important to me that empathy transferred to my website. I want
                    users to know that the creator of the website has gone through the struggles they feel every day
                    when trying to organize their hectic schedule and that making their life easier is my main goal.
                    <br>
                    <strong>Transparency:</strong> So often it feels like interfaces are trying to make the information
                    you
                    need
                    difficult to find. The goal of DOT is to clearly communicate the day’s itinerary to the user –
                    combining a calendar view with a task list that finds a connection between physical and digital
                    planning. The site will be easy to understand and navigate, giving users the control and
                    transparency that they are looking for.

                            to find. The goal of DOT is to clearly communicate the day's itinerary to the user;
                            combining a
                            calendar view with a task list that finds a connection between physical and digital
                            planning. The site will
                            be
                            easy to understand and navigate, giving users the control and transparency that they
                            are
                            looking for.</p>

                            to get back to

                            having signifiers that can be used by all types of users emphasizes the empathetic

                            therefore most of the copy text in the site is determined by the user rather than
