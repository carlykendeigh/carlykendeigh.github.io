                <h3>Design Narrative</h3>

                <p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Inspiration for DOT:</strong>
                    <br> I created DOT to be a solution for my personal life. I have struggled with staying on top of
                    tasks
                    and events my whole life, and have had to get creative in finding ways to ensure I get everything
                    done on time. I have tried physical planners, Google Calendars, and writing on the back of my hand,
                    but nothing was working. The best system I have created is Google Calendar plus a physical to-do
                    list. After consulting some close friends I realized that so many people have a similar struggle. I
                    knew I wanted to combine multiple productivity platforms by using camera scans and uploads to create
                    digital events, an idea I got from my mother. The “dots” concept on every page came from my
                    roommate, Ella, who really liked the idea of a digital bullet journal. I needed a solution for
                    myself but then began catering the experience of DOT to other people. As someone who struggles in
                    managing my tasks, I figured that I would be a good base user to test the designs on. I worked alone
                    throughout this project. While any designer may be capable of creating a calendar/to-do list, not
                    every designer would create it with the intention of being empathetic, fun, and keeping content from
                    getting overwhelming. This app has been embraced by people in my life with neurodivergence, and
                    while it benefits everyone, I especially want this app to be neurodivergent-friendly. As an ADHDer
                    myself, I had plenty of experience and dopamine training to draw on in developing this application.
                    DOT will improve the productivity levels of users once they are able to clearly visualize what tasks
                    they have ahead of them, users will be more successful in their academic and career work, and feel
                    more at peace because they will spend less time planning out their day and more time knocking out
                    their tasks. DOT exists to be a stress-reliever for hardworking individuals who overwork themselves,
                    it is the resource they need to
                    <br><br>
                    <strong>Why Desktop?:</strong>
                    <br> I am on my laptop most of the day, especially when doing productive tasks for school or work.
                    Having
                    my “home base” be in desktop format made sense for being the balancing point for working users. I
                    would like to also create versions available on mobile, and watch to allow for on-the-go check-ins
                    of daily tasks.

                    <strong>Story Inspired by UI:</strong>
                    <br> My story that fueled this product was based around Josie, a college student who balances her
                    class
                    schedule with her on-campus job as a journalist for the Daily Nebraskan. She is optimistic and
                    motivated but finds it incredibly difficult to keep track of everything that needs to be done.
                    Having recently been elected as social chair for her sorority, Josie is becoming more overwhelmed
                    and confused by her planners, calendars, and to-do lists every day. She is comfortable enough with
                    technology since she uses it in her classes and profession, but likes to use it as a reference
                    rather than her main focus as a paper planner. However, all of Josie’s school and work assignments
                    come through on digital calendars, making her have to take the time to transfer them over. DOT is
                    the solution for those like Josie. DOT takes a scan of her physical planner she takes so much care
                    in making and recognizes the handwriting to convert each task, event, and color-coded highlight to a
                    digital format where her calendars can be seen in a succinct format. When DOT doesn't just save time
                    for Josie; it restores balance to her life. Josie sits down to do her work for the day, she can pull
                    up DOT to see the tasks and events coming soonest and what she has to look forward to at the end of
                    the week. The satisfaction of popping a bubble after completing a task and seeing the amount of work
                    she has accomplished in her day is the most rewarding experience from DOT, giving users the time
                    back they desperately need to take care of themselves. For Josie, DOT becomes more than just a
                    productivity tool – it becomes a personal assistant tailored to her needs. With DOT, Josie not only
                    gains efficiency in managing her academic and social commitments but also enjoys the luxury of
                    allocating time for self-care – a factor often neglected in the life of a college student.

                    <br><br>
                    <strong>Creating the Design System:</strong>
                    <br>You describe your process of creating the design system, highlighting a few choices (a few
                    colors,
                    your fonts, why you rounded only one corner on buttons, etc.). You do not need to justify every
                    decision, just the ones you see are the most important and/or the ones you're proudest to
                    contribute.
                    <br> Colors
                    My color scheme is very neutral and warm, it is meant to be comforting and calming, pleasant without
                    being boring. The brown tones are meant to be calming similar to colors of wood and sand, which are
                    earthy and familiar to all users. Most of the shades of brown on the paint actually variations of
                    the same shade with different opacities over white, I did this because I had a hard time finding
                    color combinations that were complementary with brown, a lot of the shades were too green for my
                    liking, and it looked sickly.


                    <br> Fonts
                    The majority of the app uses the open sand font, which is a sans-style font. Very clear to read on
                    digital formatting, but also with big enough letters that were spaced out far enough to be easily
                    read as the text got smaller. The accent font is Abril Fatface, which, as the name so jokingly
                    suggests, has very thick down, strokes in a slightly slightly fun house font. This is only used for
                    the names of dates and months in the app. This is one of the only things the user is not in control
                    of their schedule everything that they actually add to their app should be completely easy to read.
                    Items that don’t change such as the month or the date or in the fancier font because they will be
                    looked at slightly less.


                    <br> Lowercase Test
                    The entirety of this app is in lowercase, except for the events added in by each user. This is to
                    reinforce the idea that the app is calming and easy to digest. The events that users input will be
                    in whatever case they choose to write or type, but the content on the app is all lowercase.


                    <br> Round Components
                    In a similar fashion to the round, sans font, the buttons throughout the application have rounded
                    corners. The rounded corners on components are relative to the size of the component, so they all
                    have the same “percentage” of roundness. Even the icons for tasks and calendars have round corners
                    or circles. The lack of sharp corners and edges also adds to the pleasant and relaxing aura of the
                    app.


                    <br> Dots
                    Since the purpose of the app is “Done On Time” or DOT, having the dots on every page outside of the
                    logo was very important to me. The lining of each hour block in the app is lined with dots instead
                    of consecutive lines.
