                    <h3 class="blogtype">LinkedIn</a></h3>
                </div>
                <img class="blogpicblog" src="images/ds1.png" alt="Linkedin Image" />
            </div>
            <p class="blogtext"> I wanted to compare the findings from the design systems reading to a website I check
                daily: LinkedIn. The
                website demonstrates an effort by the design team to achieve a cohesive and efficient layout for their
                product. However, in my research I noticed some inconsistencies, prompting a targeted approach to design
                consistency and effectiveness. There are deconstructed large design elements into smaller, atomic
                components.
                For instance, they broke down more complex interface elements like user profiles, job postings, and
                connection
                requests into fundamental building blocks. These components (profile cards, job tiles, and connection
                buttons)
                were organized into a comprehensive style guide and component library. This ensured uniformity in
                typography,
                including typefaces (e.g., Arial, Helvetica), font sizes (e.g., 16px, 18px), font weights (e.g.,
                regular,
                bold), and line-heights across the platform.
                (All found in LinkedIn’s brand design and style guide manual)

                The design system emphasized responsive layouts, showcasing how elements like profile pictures and text
                boxes
                adapt seamlessly to various screen sizes, from desktops to smartphones. This adaptability ensures a
                consistent
                user experience, regardless of the device being used, since the website has desktop and mobile versions.
                The
                inclusion of media queries and flexible grids illustrated this responsive design approach. LinkedIn’s
                evolving
                design system is exemplified by ongoing efforts to enhance accessibility. For instance, they integrated
                high
                color contrast for improved readability, making the platform more inclusive. Additionally, user feedback
                mechanisms were demonstrated, showcasing how LinkedIn incorporates user suggestions to improve the
                design
                system, validating its user-centric values.

                Incorporating the use of consistent spacing and alignment, the website demonstrated a meticulous
                attention to
                detail in spatial systems and grids. Elements such as margins, paddings, and grid layouts were
                strategically
                implemented, providing a visually organized and aesthetically pleasing design. Overall, LinkedIn's
                website
                layout exemplifies a carefully crafted design system that prioritizes consistency, accessibility, and
                user-centricity, embodying the brand's commitment to providing an optimal user experience.

                CNN's data visualization is a great example of the principles discussed in the article.
                CNN, being a major news network, does a great job of applying the Visual Information-Seeking Mantra. CNN
                uses
                interactive and engaging maps to offer an initial overview of polling results. Users can then zoom in on
                specific
                locations, filter based on , and access detailed information about each state. This approach falls in
                line with
                the emphasis on providing an overview first and then allowing users to zoom in and filter for more
                details.
                CNN's
                use of interactive charts, graphs, and data-driven visuals in their news articles effectively follows
                the
                mantra's
                principles. These visualizations enable readers to quickly find the main points of a story. If readers
                wish to
                learn more, they can interact with the graphics to explore the data in greater detail. CNN is skilled in
                presenting historical data views. This is especially noticeable in their coverage of the COVID-19
                pandemic,
                where
                they provide time-series visualizations to depict the progression of cases. This helps viewers
                understand trends
                and changes over time, focusing on providing a historical perspective. CNN's user interface is designed
                to be
                clear and organized, making sure that viewers can access the information they need without unnecessary
                complexity.
                This highlights the efficiency of the website. CNN's use of data visualization effectively embodies
                these
                principles through clear overviews, interactive exploration, historical perspectives, and organized
                visualizations, CNN makes complex data more accessible and understandable for a broader audience.</p>

                Prototyping can take on many different forms and levels of commitment from designers. To compare to
                something I
                have already become familiar with — the prototyping hierarchy is like a stage performance. Musicals or
                plays
                take
                many forms before they debut on stage for an audience, some never make it out of the practicing stage —
                some
                go
                to
                broadway. Low-fidelity prototypes are the rehearsals, rough sketches where initial ideas are tested and
                explored,
                much like the preparatory runthroughs, practices, or workshops for a show. Mid-fidelity prototypes
                relate to
                the
                dress rehearsal, finding the balance between low and high fidelity—similar to the final dress rehearsals
                where
                all
                the elements come together, but with room for adjustments. Finally, high-fidelity prototypes are the
                grand
                opening night, rehearsed and refined to closely mirror the final product —performance where everything
                comes to
                life. Just as a musical requires teamwork and dedication for success, so does prototyping!</p>

                <strong>Name: </strong>Users need to know the owner of whose work will be presented on the site. Having
                your
                name in a visible
                spot as the link back to the home page lets users clearly know who is the designer.
                <br>
                <strong>About: </strong>This section is not always found in UI portfolios, but is present more often
                than
                not.
                The About section
                is a chance for the designer to label their current position and company as well as talk on their
                experiences
                and education levels. This gives the designer a deeper personality for the user to relate to.
                <br>
                <strong>Work/Resume: </strong>
                This section is the designers space to show off the designs that they have created! They can label what
                companies they worked with, their teammates, the development process, but every aspect relates back to
                the
                individual projects the designer made. This section is the most important, since it shows the designers
                skills
                in practice instead of just in descriptions.
                <br>
                <strong>Contact: </strong>
                Users want a way to contact designers! How else would designers gain their clients? The option to see
                more
                social media platforms or reach out via email are typically seen in portfolios.
                <br>
                Seeing this information about the designs studied, I know that my portfolio needs a more personal touch
                to
                showcase my designs. The work can only speak for itself if the site I design for it supports it.
