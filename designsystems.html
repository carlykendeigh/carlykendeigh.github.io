        <strong>Direct Analysis</strong>

        <p>I wanted to compare the findings from the design systems reading to a website I check daily: LinkedIn. The
          website demonstrates an effort by the design team to achieve a cohesive and efficient layout for their
          product. However, in my research I noticed some inconsistencies, prompting a targeted approach to design
          consistency and effectiveness. There are deconstructed large design elements into smaller, atomic components.
          For instance, they broke down more complex interface elements like user profiles, job postings, and connection
          requests into fundamental building blocks. These components (profile cards, job tiles, and connection buttons)
          were organized into a comprehensive style guide and component library. This ensured uniformity in typography,
          including typefaces (e.g., Arial, Helvetica), font sizes (e.g., 16px, 18px), font weights (e.g., regular,
          bold), and line-heights across the platform.
          (All found in LinkedIn’s brand design and style guide manual)

          The design system emphasized responsive layouts, showcasing how elements like profile pictures and text boxes
          adapt seamlessly to various screen sizes, from desktops to smartphones. This adaptability ensures a consistent
          user experience, regardless of the device being used, since the website has desktop and mobile versions. The
          inclusion of media queries and flexible grids illustrated this responsive design approach. LinkedIn’s evolving
          design system is exemplified by ongoing efforts to enhance accessibility. For instance, they integrated high
          color contrast for improved readability, making the platform more inclusive. Additionally, user feedback
          mechanisms were demonstrated, showcasing how LinkedIn incorporates user suggestions to improve the design
          system, validating its user-centric values.

          Incorporating the use of consistent spacing and alignment, the website demonstrated a meticulous attention to
          detail in spatial systems and grids. Elements such as margins, paddings, and grid layouts were strategically
          implemented, providing a visually organized and aesthetically pleasing design. Overall, LinkedIn's website
          layout exemplifies a carefully crafted design system that prioritizes consistency, accessibility, and
          user-centricity, embodying the brand's commitment to providing an optimal user experience.

    <h3>CNN</a></h3>
    <strong> Direct Analysis</strong>
    <p>CNN's data visualization is a great example of the principles discussed in the article.
      CNN, being a major news network, does a great job of applying the Visual Information-Seeking Mantra. CNN uses
      interactive and engaging maps to offer an initial overview of polling results. Users can then zoom in on specific
      locations, filter based on , and access detailed information about each state. This approach falls in line with
      the emphasis on providing an overview first and then allowing users to zoom in and filter for more details. CNN's
      use of interactive charts, graphs, and data-driven visuals in their news articles effectively follows the mantra's
      principles. These visualizations enable readers to quickly find the main points of a story. If readers wish to
      learn more, they can interact with the graphics to explore the data in greater detail. CNN is skilled in
      presenting historical data views. This is especially noticeable in their coverage of the COVID-19 pandemic, where
      they provide time-series visualizations to depict the progression of cases. This helps viewers understand trends
      and changes over time, focusing on providing a historical perspective. CNN's user interface is designed to be
      clear and organized, making sure that viewers can access the information they need without unnecessary complexity.
      This highlights the efficiency of the website. CNN's use of data visualization effectively embodies these
      principles through clear overviews, interactive exploration, historical perspectives, and organized
      visualizations, CNN makes complex data more accessible and understandable for a broader audience.</p>

      <h3>Prototyping in Figma</a></h3>
      <strong>Approximate Analogy</strong>
      <p>Prototyping can take on many different forms and levels of commitment from designers. To compare to something I
        have already become familiar with — the prototyping hierarchy is like a stage performance. Musicals or plays
        take
        many forms before they debut on stage for an audience, some never make it out of the practicing stage — some go
        to
        broadway. Low-fidelity prototypes are the rehearsals, rough sketches where initial ideas are tested and
        explored,
        much like the preparatory runthroughs, practices, or workshops for a show. Mid-fidelity prototypes relate to the
        dress rehearsal, finding the balance between low and high fidelity—similar to the final dress rehearsals where
        all
        the elements come together, but with room for adjustments. Finally, high-fidelity prototypes are the grand
        opening
        night, rehearsed and refined to closely mirror the final product —performance where everything comes to life.
        Just
        as a musical requires teamwork and dedication for success, so does prototyping!</p>

      <h3>Portfolios</a></h3>
      <strong>Tutorial</strong>
      <p> <strong>Name: </strong>Users need to know the owner of whose work will be presented on the site. Having your name in a visible
        spot as the link back to the home page lets users clearly know who is the designer.
<br>
        <strong>About: </strong>This section is not always found in UI portfolios, but is present more often than not. The About section
        is a chance for the designer to label their current position and company as well as talk on their experiences
        and education levels. This gives the designer a deeper personality for the user to relate to.
<br>
        <strong>Work/Resume: </strong>
        This section is the designers space to show off the designs that they have created! They can label what
        companies they worked with, their teammates, the development process, but every aspect relates back to the
        individual projects the designer made. This section is the most important, since it shows the designers skills
        in practice instead of just in descriptions.
<br>
        <strong>Contact: </strong>
        Users want a way to contact designers! How else would designers gain their clients? The option to see more
        social media platforms or reach out via email are typically seen in portfolios.
<br>
        Seeing this information about the designs studied, I know that my portfolio needs a more personal touch to
        showcase my designs. The work can only speak for itself if the site I design for it supports it.
