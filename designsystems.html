        <strong>Direct Analysis</strong>

        <p>I wanted to compare the findings from the design systems reading to a website I check daily: LinkedIn. The
          website demonstrates an effort by the design team to achieve a cohesive and efficient layout for their
          product. However, in my research I noticed some inconsistencies, prompting a targeted approach to design
          consistency and effectiveness. There are deconstructed large design elements into smaller, atomic components.
          For instance, they broke down more complex interface elements like user profiles, job postings, and connection
          requests into fundamental building blocks. These components (profile cards, job tiles, and connection buttons)
          were organized into a comprehensive style guide and component library. This ensured uniformity in typography,
          including typefaces (e.g., Arial, Helvetica), font sizes (e.g., 16px, 18px), font weights (e.g., regular,
          bold), and line-heights across the platform.
          (All found in LinkedIn’s brand design and style guide manual)

          The design system emphasized responsive layouts, showcasing how elements like profile pictures and text boxes
          adapt seamlessly to various screen sizes, from desktops to smartphones. This adaptability ensures a consistent
          user experience, regardless of the device being used, since the website has desktop and mobile versions. The
          inclusion of media queries and flexible grids illustrated this responsive design approach. LinkedIn’s evolving
          design system is exemplified by ongoing efforts to enhance accessibility. For instance, they integrated high
          color contrast for improved readability, making the platform more inclusive. Additionally, user feedback
          mechanisms were demonstrated, showcasing how LinkedIn incorporates user suggestions to improve the design
          system, validating its user-centric values.

          Incorporating the use of consistent spacing and alignment, the website demonstrated a meticulous attention to
          detail in spatial systems and grids. Elements such as margins, paddings, and grid layouts were strategically
          implemented, providing a visually organized and aesthetically pleasing design. Overall, LinkedIn's website
          layout exemplifies a carefully crafted design system that prioritizes consistency, accessibility, and
          user-centricity, embodying the brand's commitment to providing an optimal user experience.

      <h3>CNN</a></h3>
      <strong> Direct Analysis</strong>
      <p>CNN's data visualization is a great example of the principles discussed in the article.
        CNN, being a major news network, does a great job of applying the Visual Information-Seeking Mantra. CNN uses
        interactive and engaging maps to offer an initial overview of polling results. Users can then zoom in on
        specific
        locations, filter based on , and access detailed information about each state. This approach falls in line with
        the emphasis on providing an overview first and then allowing users to zoom in and filter for more details.
        CNN's
        use of interactive charts, graphs, and data-driven visuals in their news articles effectively follows the
        mantra's
        principles. These visualizations enable readers to quickly find the main points of a story. If readers wish to
        learn more, they can interact with the graphics to explore the data in greater detail. CNN is skilled in
        presenting historical data views. This is especially noticeable in their coverage of the COVID-19 pandemic,
        where
        they provide time-series visualizations to depict the progression of cases. This helps viewers understand trends
        and changes over time, focusing on providing a historical perspective. CNN's user interface is designed to be
        clear and organized, making sure that viewers can access the information they need without unnecessary
        complexity.
        This highlights the efficiency of the website. CNN's use of data visualization effectively embodies these
        principles through clear overviews, interactive exploration, historical perspectives, and organized
        visualizations, CNN makes complex data more accessible and understandable for a broader audience.</p>

          <h3>Prototyping in Figma</a></h3>
          <strong>Approximate Analogy</strong>
          <p>Prototyping can take on many different forms and levels of commitment from designers. To compare to
            something I
            have already become familiar with — the prototyping hierarchy is like a stage performance. Musicals or plays
            take
            many forms before they debut on stage for an audience, some never make it out of the practicing stage — some
            go
            to
            broadway. Low-fidelity prototypes are the rehearsals, rough sketches where initial ideas are tested and
            explored,
            much like the preparatory runthroughs, practices, or workshops for a show. Mid-fidelity prototypes relate to
            the
            dress rehearsal, finding the balance between low and high fidelity—similar to the final dress rehearsals
            where
            all
            the elements come together, but with room for adjustments. Finally, high-fidelity prototypes are the grand
            opening
            night, rehearsed and refined to closely mirror the final product —performance where everything comes to
            life.
            Just
            as a musical requires teamwork and dedication for success, so does prototyping!</p>

          <h3>Portfolios</a></h3>
          <strong>Tutorial</strong>
          <p> <strong>Name: </strong>Users need to know the owner of whose work will be presented on the site. Having
            your
            name in a visible
            spot as the link back to the home page lets users clearly know who is the designer.
            <br>
            <strong>About: </strong>This section is not always found in UI portfolios, but is present more often than
            not.
            The About section
            is a chance for the designer to label their current position and company as well as talk on their
            experiences
            and education levels. This gives the designer a deeper personality for the user to relate to.
            <br>
            <strong>Work/Resume: </strong>
            This section is the designers space to show off the designs that they have created! They can label what
            companies they worked with, their teammates, the development process, but every aspect relates back to the
            individual projects the designer made. This section is the most important, since it shows the designers
            skills
            in practice instead of just in descriptions.
            <br>
            <strong>Contact: </strong>
            Users want a way to contact designers! How else would designers gain their clients? The option to see more
            social media platforms or reach out via email are typically seen in portfolios.
            <br>
            Seeing this information about the designs studied, I know that my portfolio needs a more personal touch to
            showcase my designs. The work can only speak for itself if the site I design for it supports it.

        <h3>Instructions:</h3>
        <p>Identify the two core values for your UI. Write a few sentences about each one and
          why they are especially relevant to your UI</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Empathy</strong>
            <span="c2 c1">: The sole purpose of
              DOT is For users
              to finally have a way to get separate components of their lives into one easily digestible and clearly
              formatted
              dashboard. As someone who highly values empathy in my own life, it was very important to me that empathy
              transferred to my website. I want users to know that the creator of the website has gone through the
              struggles
              they feel every day when trying to organize their hectic schedule and that making their life easier is my
              main
              goal.
          </li>
          <li><strong>Transparency:</strong> So often it feels like interfaces
            are to make the information you need difficult
            to find. The goal of DOT is to clearly communicate the day's itinerary to the user; combining a
            calendar view with a task list that finds a connection between physical and digital planning. The site will
            be
            easy to understand and navigate, giving users the control and transparency that they are looking for.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <p>Explain how you will express that core value in your UI. You need at least 3
          strategies per value (copy, colors, signifiers, etc. can all count as strategies, but they are by no means a
          comprehensive list).</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Signifier</strong>: My website will utilize icons
            that have clearly stated alternative text, so the purpose of each button is very simple. to get back to
            the main dashboard, the users will click on the logo. to see the calendar view, the usual click on the
            calendar.
            to make a new scan, users click on the plus button. if the user needs to access their settings or log out,
            there
            are two buttons; one that looks like a gear and the other the word "logout", respectively.
            having signifiers that can be used by all types of users emphasizes the empathetic and transparent values of
            the
            site.</li>
          <li> <strong>Multiple Calendar Views:</strong> Not everyone likes
            to look at their schedule the same way. some weeks are too busy to only look one day at a time, because of
            this
            the users can access all of their tasks and events that they want to look at in three different formats
            (day,
            week, month). This gives them a feeling of personalization and a higher sense of control since they get
            to
            customize how they view their content without having to put in too much work to change the layout. being
            able
            to
            scan multiple types of physical, analog calendars, planners, habit trackers, to-do lists, and whatever else
            the
            user could need easily allows them to get the personalized view that makes looking at the upcoming tasks as
            simple and stress-free as possible.</li>
          <li><strong>Copy:</strong>
            All text you within the DOT
            interface
            is highly intentional. while there are tool tips and instructions varied throughout the site the majority of
            the
            text should always be the user-specific content and not DOT instructions. This interface is truly the
            means between a user and their schedule, and will not be used for advertising its own interests or agendas.
            therefore most of the copy text in the site is determined by the user rather than myself. the text is
            whatever
            they have going on that day (or week or month), rather than what <i> I</i>want them to feel. </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Develop a list of all the pages that would likely be included in a full version
          of
          your UI. Think critically about how your users will navigate your UI for all their tasks. By making this list,
          you
          are not committing to building these pages, but you will include the page titles in the mockup of your
          navigation
          menu.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Login</li>
          <li>Register </li>
          <li>Initial preferences page</li>
          <li>Dashboard month view, week view, day view</li>
          <li>Dot page: tasks &amp; events for today</li>
          <li>New scan upload</li>
          <li>Settings &amp; preferences</li>
        </ul>
        <p></p>
        <p>Arrange those pages into a sensical navigation tree. For the sake of this
          assignment,
          you can use outline style to display the nesting. Bold the pages you actually plan to build.
